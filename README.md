# 📐 Geometry Solver (Java)

## 🧾 Overview

**Geometry Solver** is a beginner-friendly Java project designed to calculate the **area**, **perimeter**, **volume**, and **surface area** of commonly used 2D and 3D geometric shapes.  
The program uses conditional statements and mathematical logic to prompt the user for inputs and perform calculations accordingly.

It is ideal for those learning:
- Java basics
- Conditional structures (`if`, `switch`)
- Method creation and usage
- Java’s built-in `Math` class
- Simple user input handling using `Scanner`

---

## ✨ Features

- Supports **2D shapes**: Circle, Square, Rectangle, Triangle
- Supports **3D shapes**: Sphere, Cube, Cylinder, Cone
- User-friendly console-based interaction
- Accurate calculations using standard geometry formulas
- Organized and readable Java code

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java 8 or higher
- Math library (`java.lang.Math`)
- Scanner for input (`java.util.Scanner`)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Compile the file**:
   ```bash
   javac GeometrySolver.java

2. Run the program:
